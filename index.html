            <p>
              Atmos Grill & BBQ strives to create an old school <em>Americana</em>
              atmosphere building on the traditions of a 1950's generation. We
              want to recreate every aspect of America's old dining experience
              including: the energy, friendliness of staff, classic upbeat music,
              and everything in-between. Expect second-to-none customer service
              and a quality in all of our dishes that will keep every Atmos
              customer that tries us once to come back for a second time. Located
              on the easy access Center Street in Dallas.</p>
